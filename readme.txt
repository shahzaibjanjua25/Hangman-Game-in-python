The program is a hangman game. The UI consists of a word label that displays the current state of the word to guess, a guess label that displays the remaining guesses, a guess input field, a guess button, a new game button, a hint button, and an image label that displays the current state of the hanging man. 

The `GameLogic` class contains the game's logic, such as the words to guess, the guessed letters, the number of guesses, and the methods to handle guessing, reset the game, get a hint, and determine if the game is over or won.

The `UI` class is responsible for displaying the game's UI and connecting the UI signals to the `GameLogic` slots. It updates the UI based on the `GameLogic` state and handles the user's input.

The `Main` class is responsible for creating the `GameLogic` and `UI` instances and running the `QApplication` event loop. The `Main` class is not used in the current version of the program, as the `__name__ == '__main__'` block creates the `GameLogic` and `UI` instances and runs the event loop.
